# led-dodecahedron
A 3D-printed "infinity lights" dodecahedron

This project was largely based on this instructable, which I strongely recommend if you intend to make your own (https://www.instructables.com/Infinity-Dodecahedron-Mirror/), although I used different 3D edge.
The 3D model I used for edges were based on these ones  (https://www.printables.com/fr/model/41457-diy-infinity-dodecahedron/comments).
I modified there length to make them smaller. What I didn't anticipated is that is simple scaling along their length axis makes the junction part not compatible with each other, as it's changing the angles of the male and female parts.
I used blender to edit them and it took me a lot of tries until I came up with edges having the proper size and able to fit with each other.
